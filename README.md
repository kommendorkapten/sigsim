# Simple signature implementation

:warning: This project should not be used for anything else than
educational purposes.

This package imlements elliptic curve generation, ECDSA signing and
verification. It was written with the only purpose of education of the
foundations for elliptic cuve signatures.

The code is not efficient implemented at all, it favours simple code
so that the functionality can easily be understood, and verified.
